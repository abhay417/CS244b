Students sometimes object to being asked to invest time using software
with a "restrictive" license such as the GPL.  Though the author does
not believe the GPL is restrictive, he provides the following option
to address this concern:  Any student who received credit for
Stanford's CS244b class in Autumn quarter 2014 may additionally
re-license any snapshot of xdrpp from any point in 2014 under the
following so-called "MIT" license:

	Copyright (C) 2014 David Mazieres.

	Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person
	obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation
	files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without

	sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the
	Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following
	conditions:

	The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be

	LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR

To relicense the software, simply replace this file with the above
indented text, and at the top write "Relicensed by <YOUR NAME> on
<DATE> by permission of the author."  Since the MIT license is
transferable, any entity that hires an Autumn 2014 CS244b student may
end up using the software under the MIT license with that student's
permission.


Similarly, Stellar Development Foundation (who hired the author) may
relicense any version of xdrpp under any license the foundation sees
fit.
